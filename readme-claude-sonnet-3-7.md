## Overview
This repository contains Terraform configurations for deploying and managing Azure infrastructure. It is optimized for working with Claude Sonnet 3.7 for intelligent infrastructure provisioning and management.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized to facilitate Azure resource deployment using Terraform as the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.
